decore Base | UI fastly
=======================
Introduction
------------
decore Base is an out-of-the-box "Python to Vue.js" data application dashboard that helps you go from idea to view in a few simple steps. It is aimed at those who want to focus on the results of their algorithms, do scientific work or perform teaching and learning functions.

Notes
-----
**decore Base is currently a work in progress, only locally deployable, only available for Windows and not yet production ready**.

The recommended IDE is Visual Studio Code and all my comments and documentation here will also refer to vscode only.

This documentation was translated from German into English with Deepl.

Features and Integrations
-------------------------
- Ready-made SPA (Single Page Application) with Vue.js using Quasar Framework (https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar)
- Predefined Webapi for meta and actions with Flask (https://github.com/pallets/flask)
- Integrated ORM for data management and database interfaces (SQLite) powered by the great Peewee (https://github.com/coleifer/peewee)
- Data validation using Cerberus (https://github.com/pyeve/cerberus)
- Password management using pykeepass (https://github.com/libkeepass/pykeepass)

Please support these great projects!

Contribution
------------
The biggest help I can get right now is if you take a look at the project and tell me what you think. I am grateful for any criticism.

My current sample project is included directly in the Python package. To install the example application, please read the documentation in **Example**. Please read **Installation**, **Use** and **Preparation** first.

Anything found in the documentation in terms of features, bugs or ambiguities, please let me know.

`Please use the problem area in the repository for this purpose. <https://github.com/KemoPanzah/decore_Base/issues>`_
