Sample application
------------------
To better understand how decore base works, it is best to look at the sample application. The application represents my continuous development of decore base.

To synchronize the sample application with a subfolder of the project root directory, run ``python app.py --sample`` in your project root directory. Use the terminal in vscode.

To run the sample application after synchronization, use your debugger with the ``[smp] decore base sample`` profile in vscode.
