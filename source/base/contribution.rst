Contribution
------------
The biggest help I can get right now is if you take a look at the project and tell me what you think. I am grateful for any criticism.

My current sample project is included directly in the Python package. To install the example application, please read the documentation in **Example**. Please read **Installation**, **Use** and **Preparation** first.

Anything found in the documentation in terms of features, bugs or ambiguities, please let me know.

`Please use the problem area in the repository for this purpose. <https://github.com/KemoPanzah/decore_Base/issues>`_
