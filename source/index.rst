Welcome to decore People!
==========================

Hey guys welcome to the decore website. Here you will find everything you need to get informed and participate.

decore is currently divided into 2 main paths:

decore Base | UI fastly
-----------------------

An out-of-the-box "Python to Vue.js" data application dashboard that helps you go from idea to view in a few simple steps. It is aimed at those who want to focus on the results of their algorithms, do scientific work or perform teaching and learning functions.

decore Front | UI defined
-------------------------

a closed-source project that uses the meta-information defined with decore Base to generate a UI. This UI is then able to visualize and manipulate the data.

.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1

   decore Base <base/index>
